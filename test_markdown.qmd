The following script should take 50 seconds to run:

```{r}
# record start time
start_time = Sys.time()
```

```{r}
# create a loop that iterates 5 times and sets system to sleep for 10 seconds
for (i in 1:5) {
  cat("Iteration", i, "\n")
  Sys.sleep(10)
}
```

```{r}
# record end time
end_time = Sys.time()

# print total execution time
total_time = as.numeric(difftime(end_time, start_time, units = "secs"))
```

```{r}
# write results to txt file
write(paste("Total execution time: ", total_time, "seconds"), file = "execution_time.txt")
```
